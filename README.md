# COVID19_RShiny
An  R Shiny dashboard for visualizing the cumulative and daily trends of COVID-19 across countries. The data is sourced from OurWorldInData which inturn is from [European Center for Disease and Prevention (ECDC) via Our World In Data servers] (https://covid.ourworldindata.org/). The basic function of this dashboard is to depict the cumulative and daily trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths by enabling users to plot any country they wish to look for. 

### Statistical parameters
Users have the option to smoothen the plot based on locally weighted regression LOESS smoothing, plot in logarithmic (base 10) scale and also to plot the population adjusted numbers. The population adjustment is done in such a way that the numbers reflect those per one million of population. Logarithmic scale will be useful in visualizing the epidemic trends when the numbers are largely different between countries in the plot. Note that the a unit change in the logarithmic y-axis corresponds to a 10-fold change in the original numbers. 

### ggplot2 graphs
All the visualizations are generated by using ggplot2 package and its associated functions. To demonstrate the capability of changing the styles of the graphs, users are also provided some options to change the plot style - eg:- background color, border types, grid line types, etc. Note that these options are not comprehensive for ggplot2 and many more customizations are actually possible. This is just to demonstrate the scope of some essential plot styles. Note that the colors of lines representing countries within the plot is not changeable and these are all default ggplot2 colors.
